I love engineering, both software and mechanical. This has led to a love for 3d printing, and designing things to be 3d printed. The following is a list of ideas for things that I would like to design, or have designed.

- Play kitchen items:
	- Cup with lid and straw
	- Plates
	- Tea pot
	- Foaming soap bottle
- Tortilla press
- Modular mini server rack
