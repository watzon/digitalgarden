# Welcome to My Digital Garden

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f0939987-5b78-47a7-837f-ec5de2a99573/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/keen-narwhal-5b89e7/deploys)

My ADHD brain craves structure, but at the same time makes true order seem like an unobtainable goal reserved only for those who don't need to pop a 54mg Ritalin at the start of the day to have any hope of being productive. This is my attempt, however "last ditch" it may seem, to organize my thoughts and share that process with anyone else who cares to look.

This will not replace my blog, which you can find [here](https://watzon.tech/posts), but it will hopefully provide me a place to store things and reflect on them later.

## What is a Digital Garden?
Honestly this is an idea that's new to me, so I wouldn't be the best person to explain it. It would be worth reading [[Bookmarks and Highlights/Collections/Articles/A Brief History and Ethos of the Digital Garden\|A Brief History and Ethos of the Digital Garden]] though if you'd like to learn about it.

Speaking on this digital garden though, I use Obsidian for note taking and the [Obsidian Digital Garden](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) plugin to handle publishing notes to [Github](https://github.com/watzon/digitalgarden). The site is hosted through Netlify which automatically builds and deploys when new changes are pushed to Github.
