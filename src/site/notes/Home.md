# Welcome to My Digital Garden

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f0939987-5b78-47a7-837f-ec5de2a99573/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/keen-narwhal-5b89e7/deploys)

My ADHD brain craves structure, but at the same time makes true order seem like an unobtainable goal reserved only for those who don't need to pop a 54mg Ritalin at the start of the day to have any hope of being productive. This is my attempt, however "last ditch" it may seem, to organize my thoughts and share that process with anyone else who cares to look.

This will not replace my blog, which you can find [here](https://watzon.tech/posts), but it will hopefully provide me a place to store things and reflect on them later.
