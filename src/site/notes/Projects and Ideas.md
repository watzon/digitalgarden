The following are personal web and software projects, and ideas for future projects.

## [[Self hosted Cloudinary alternative\|Self hosted Cloudinary alternative]]
There are several open source projects which claim to be alternatives to Cloudinary, but all of them (that I can find) are completely API based and work on URLs to existing images. What I would like to see is a full self-hosted website which allows you to upload images, apply modifications, and grab links to the cached image.

## [[Site for sharing filament profiles for 3D printing\|Site for sharing filament profiles for 3D printing]]
Most major slicers support importing and exporting filament profiles, which is extremely useful... if you have a place to share them. Unfortunately I don't know of a good place for sharing profiles, regardless of printer, filament, or slicer.

## [Simple CURL-able paste bin](https://0x45.st)
This already exists in the form of [0x0](https://0x0.st), but I recreated it anyway using Crystal.

## [API based alternative to carbon.now.sh](https://inkify.0x45.st)
Carbon (at the moment) doesn't provide an API, and when it does the API will probably be a paid feature. While I don't mind supporting indie developers, I also like self-hosting things where I can.
