There are several open source projects which claim to be alternatives to Cloudinary and [[Bookmarks and Highlights/Collections/Articles/A handier Cloudinary alternative Uploadcare. Review and comparison â€” Uploadcare Blog\|Uploadcare]], but all of them (that I can find) are completely API based and work on URLs to existing images. What I would like to see is a full self-hosted website which allows you to upload images, apply modifications, and grab links to the cached image.

## Stack
- [Athena](https://athenaframework.org/) backend (Crystal web framework inspired by Symfony)
- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) frontend

Since I'll be using Crystal, it only make sense to use [Pixie](https://github.com/watzon/pixie) as an ImageMagick library. If I didn't dislike Django and Flask so much I would probably use [Pillow-SMID](https://github.com/uploadcare/pillow-simd) like Uploadcare does, but _c'est la vie_.

## Ideas
- I want to make the URL format very similar to what Cloudinary does (`/:uuid/-/:transform/:options`). This should be pretty easy to do in Athena [^1].
- This should include support for [[Bookmarks and Highlights/Collections/Programming/Progressive JPEG images What Is It and How It Can Improve Website Performance\|progressive JPEG's]] and other optimizations.
- To start off with I'm imagining something pretty simple:
	- There needs to be a way to upload files and manage uploaded files.
	- Clicking a file should take you to a page where you can apply transformations to the image and get a link.
- In the future things can get more advanced:
	- Analytics
	- Real-time editor
	- JavaScript libraries for popular frameworks
	- Embeddable uploader
	- Webhooks
