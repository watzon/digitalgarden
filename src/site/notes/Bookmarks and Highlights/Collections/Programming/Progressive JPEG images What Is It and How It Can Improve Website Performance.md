&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The standard JPEG format loads images one line at a time, from top to bottom, and each line is already pixel perfect. Hence, it can take a while for the picture to load fully.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;As for progressive JPEG, the image appears all at once as a whole, but it’ll be blurry and pixelated a first. Gradually, you will see a clear and fully loaded image.
