# So your bot is rate limited...

You wrote a bot, it got popular...  and now it&#39;s lagging because you are getting 429 errors and being rate limited.  It happens.  Follow this guide, and you should get your bot working again in no time.
If you have any questions or comments on this guide, feel free to message @TheRealPara
