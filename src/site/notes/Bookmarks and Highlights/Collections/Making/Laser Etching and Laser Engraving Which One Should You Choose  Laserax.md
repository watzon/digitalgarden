> The main difference between laser etching and laser engraving is that etching melts the micro surface to create raised marks, whereas engraving removes material to create deep marks. Both processes use high heat to create permanent markings on metal surfaces.

> You may need laser etching if:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;	Your part is made of any metal, except stainless steel
&gt;	You want the fastest laser process
&gt;	You want a cost-effective laser that requires less laser power
&gt;	You need to integrate laser marking before non-abrasive treatments, including powder coating, e-coating, and heat treating
